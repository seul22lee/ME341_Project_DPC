# DPC Policy Training and Implementation Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project is designed for training and implementing a **Deep Predictive Control (DPC) Policy model**. Specifically, the project provides code for:

- Defining and training the neural network model (**DPC Policy**).
- Generating and managing datasets for training.
- Applying the trained model to real predictive control tasks.

The project leverages a pre-trained prediction model (**TiDE**) provided directly from Reference [2].

### Main Files

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `DPC_Policy.py` | Defines the neural network architecture for the **DPC Policy**. |
